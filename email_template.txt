Example for above template:
Dear Max,
I hope this message finds you well.
I'm writing to express my interest in the Backend Engineer position at X Labs. With hands-on experience in backend systems, cloud infrastructure I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.
Currently, I'm interning at the Allen Institute for Al, where I've worked on large scale hypothesis evaluation systems for LLMs. Previously, at M C and D, I engineered distributed microservices, built CI/CD pipelines, and containerized event driven architectures using Kubernetes and Docker. My academic foundation in computer science, coupled with a strong track record of delivering reliable, performant backend solutions, aligns well with the challenges at Vest.
I'm particularly drawn to your mission of building trustless financial infrastructure. The intersection of distributed systems, algorithmic design, and cryptographic security is exactly where I want to be.
I've attached my resume for your review. I would welcome the chance to speak further and learn more about the role and your vision at Vest Labs. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Best regards,
Sam Altman
