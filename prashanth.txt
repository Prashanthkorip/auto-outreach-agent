Experience : 

Associate Software Developer | Oracle Corporation Aug 2022 – Jan 2024

• Built scalable ML inference pipelines to transition models from AWS to OCI, and enhanced OCI dashboards to support
real-time risk ranking and visualization, improving decision-making for customers like the US Army and Pfizer.
• Integrated Newmetrix’s AI-powered safety risk models into Oracle Construction Intelligence Cloud (CIC) post-acquisition,
enabling predictive analytics and automated safety insights for construction clients.
• Engineered and deployed a multi-tenant platform, ’Oracle Lobby,’ with integrated unified authentication for multiple Primavera
applications, streamlining user access and reducing login times by 30%.
• Optimized PL/SQL scripts and SQL queries for Primavera Analytics, resolving Data Warehousing issues with sources like P6,
Unifier, and tools like OBI and OCI, improving query speed and system reliability by 20%.

Data Analyst Intern | Oracle Corporation Jan 2022 – July 2022

• Acquired expertise in Oracle tools like Primavera, P6, and OCI within 3 months by actively engaging in training, concurrently
working on tasks, and manually testing daily runs, resulting in enhanced tool reliability and project efficiency.
• Automated daily and weekly test runs using Selenium for Oracle’s analytics platforms, streamlining UI/UX workflows and
functional testing, reducing manual testing time by 50% and improving testing efficiency.
• Led the successful migration of 15,000 Confluence documentations from CEGBU to GBU, ensuring no data loss by developing
an automated script to validate and cross-check content, resulting in streamlined access and better collaboration across teams.

Projects : 

AR HUD Navigation | PyTorch, WandB, CUDA, Unity
• Developed an AI-powered lane detection system using Barracuda for precise HUD and waypoint alignment in Unity.
• Engineered an ML-based navigation framework to compute and present real-time directional guidance with checkpoints.
• Enhanced model inference for minimal latency, ensuring smooth integration within a simulated AR environment.

SAMMY AI Chatbot | Python, NLP, RAG, LLM
• Built ‘Sammy,’ an LLM-powered retrieval system using RAG for SJSU, providing 24/7 responses with 100% positive feedback.
• Optimized inference to support 20 users on a V100 with 200ms latency, scaling to 500 via distributed inference on 8 A100s.
• Engineered a confidence-based response modulation system, dynamically adjusting the chatbot’s tone to ensure contextual
sensitivity and reducing 99% of model hallucinations in query responses.

Perception & Path-Planning System | PyTorch, TensorRT, WandB, Distributed Training, Autonomous Systems
• Developed an object detection pipeline for RGB Camera with TensorRT, achieving 98% accuracy at 35 FPS.
• Built a reinforcement learning-based path-planning module, maintaining 90% speed and lane compliance in urban areas.
• Optimized multi-GPU training with MLOps, cutting training time by 40% while using WandB for tracking.

EBay Challenge Entity Extraction (Team Name: Edgerunners) | Python, Ollama, Dspy, PyTorch, TorchTune
• Fine-tuned Llama 3.1 with LoRA to map 5M+ automobile part records to compatible car models in Year-Make-Model format,
utilizing 300GB of website data for improved accuracy.
• Designed a distributed inference system across multiple GPU nodes on HPC, cutting inference time from 10 days (single A100
GPU) to 23 hours using 16 A100 GPUs.
• Applied entropy-based sampling to filter high-confidence predictions, increasing the F0.2 score by 13% (0.49 to 0.62).

Achievements: 

• Achieved 5th Rank in eBay Machine Learning Challenge (2024), USA: Successfully tackled entity
extraction for mapping 5M+ automobile part records to compatible car models.
• Massachusetts Institute of Technology Covid Challenge, Winning Team (2020): Won the hackathon by
developing a digital loan approval system for unregistered MSMEs to address key challenges faced by small businesses.
